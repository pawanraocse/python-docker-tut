My Python Docker Application
This repository contains a Dockerized Python application. Follow the steps below to pull and run the Docker image.

This documentation guides you through setting up and running a Python application packaged as a Docker image.

Prerequisites
Docker: Download and install Docker from the official website: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/.
Optional:

Docker Compose: Install Docker Compose if you prefer a multi-container setup. Download it from the official website: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
Running the Application
Pull the Docker Image:

Bash
docker pull pawanraocse/my-python-image:1.0

This downloads the pre-built image named pawanraocse/my-python-image (version 1.0) from Docker Hub.

Run the Docker Container:

Bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 pawanraocse/my-python-image:1.0

This command starts a container from the downloaded image and maps the container's port 8000 to port 8000 on your local machine. This allows you to access the application through your browser.

Access the Application:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000. You should see "Hello, World!" displayed by your application.

Using Docker Compose (Optional)
For managing multi-container applications, Docker Compose provides a convenient option.

Create a docker-compose.yml file:

YAML
version: '3.8'

services:
web:
image: pawanraocse/my-python-image:1.0
ports: - "8000:8000"
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Run the Application:

Bash
docker-compose up
This command starts all services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

Managing Docker Objects
Stopping Containers:

Using docker command: Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running the container.
Using Docker Compose: docker-compose down
Viewing Information:

Images: docker images (Lists all Docker images)
Running Containers: docker ps (Lists running containers)
Removing Objects:

Images: docker rmi pawanraocse/my-python-image:1.0 (Replace with the actual image name)

Containers:

Stop the container if running: docker stop <container_id> (Replace with container ID from docker ps)
Remove the container: docker rm <container_id>
Troubleshooting
Ensure Docker is installed and running.
Verify port 8000 is not in use by another application.
Refer to Docker documentation (https://docs.docker.com/) or contact the repository maintainers for further assistance.
